# RANCH - Rust Agent Networking & Coordination Hub

A robust multi-agent system built in Rust for managing, coordinating, and facilitating communication between autonomous agents.

## About RANCH

**RANCH** stands for **R**ust **A**gent **N**etworking & **C**oordination **H**ub** - a powerful framework designed to bring together multiple autonomous agents in a cohesive, managed environment. Just as a physical ranch serves as a gathering place for livestock, our RANCH project serves as a digital hub where various AI agents can collaborate, communicate, and coordinate their activities.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Seamlessly manage and orchestrate multiple autonomous agents
- **Rust-Based Performance**: Built with Rust for memory safety, concurrency, and optimal performance
- **A2A Protocol Support**: Implements the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol
- **Real-time Communication**: Efficient networking and message passing between agents
- **Task Management**: Advanced task orchestration and workload distribution
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy customization and extension

## Architecture

The project is structured around several key components:

- **a2a-protocol**: Core implementation of the Agent-to-Agent communication protocol
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Central hub for agent management and orchestration
- **Communication layers**: HTTP and JSON-RPC transport protocols
- **Task management**: Distributed task execution and monitoring

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd multi_agent

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the examples
cargo run --example basic_agent
```
