## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **SSRF Vulnerabilities** - Critical security risk
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive validation and testing
   - External security audit before release

2. **Webhook Flood Attacks** - Resource exhaustion
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting and queue size limits
   - Load testing with realistic scenarios

### Medium Risk
1. **DNS Rebinding** - Complex attack vector
   - Mitigation: Pre-resolve and re-validate IPs
   - Reference existing security libraries

2. **Retry Storm** - Cascading failures
   - Mitigation: Exponential backoff with jitter
   - Circuit breaker pattern

### Low Risk
1. **Storage Performance** - In-memory should be fast
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize if needed
   - Design for future persistent stores

---

## Metrics for Success

- [ ] 310+ total tests passing (150+ new)
- [ ] 90%+ code coverage for webhook module

## Notes

- Focus on security first, performance second
- Start with in-memory storage, design for persistence
- Keep webhook payloads spec-compliant
- Extensive testing is critical for security
- Consider hiring security expert for SSRF audit
